The _Wildlife Justice Commission_ is a NGO where law enforcement and legal experts 
fighting transnational organised wildlife crime. The Wildlife Justice Commission’s 
Intelligence Unit undertakes the collection, collation and analysis of information 
that we use to create tactical, operational and strategic intelligence assessments 
in support of current investigations, as well as dissemination to law enforcement 
agencies or other entities.

_WildLeaks_ is a not-for-profit collaborative project created, funded and managed 
by Earth League International – ELI (formerly Elephant Action League). In assessing 
the information received by WildLeaks, ELI is often helped and supported by a 
network of experts that includes crime experts, environmental lawyers, legal and 
criminal justice experts, biologists, journalists, security and technology 
professionals, and former law enforcement officers.
