-	**Geographical information systems**. During my bachelor I first started learning GIS, first an introductory course which I followed on exchange, at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Subsequently I took the advanced course of GIS at my home university, Leiden University College. GIS is relevant for Earth Scientists, as GIS provides a powerful means of looking at the world and tools for solving complex problems. It plays a vital role in scientific research, with a broad array of applications for spatial data and visualizations in earth science.
-	**Microsoft Office** (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.). Word is extremely easy for producing text documents, Excel has significant ability to analyse, visualise and model data, and Powerpoint is an easy tool to present findings. 
-	**R and R studio** are useful for statistical analysis and long time series. R is easier to learn compared to other computer languages. As ecologists and other earth scientists are not computer scientists, an easy to learn software is better. 
-	**LaTeX** is my preferred software to create text documents as it is visually pleasing and also relatively easy to learn. 
-	**MATLAB** is one of the best software for all kind of programming and modelling. It can be used for image processing, signal processing, statistical, and mapping toolboxes within the context of Earth science problems.

In this module I learned about **git bash, github openrefine, LibreOffice** and **SQL**.
