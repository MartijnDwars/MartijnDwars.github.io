With an interdisciplinary Bachelor degree in **Earth, Energy and Sustainability**, 
I continued my studies at the University of Edinburgh, where I did a Master in 
**Global Environment and Climage Change Law**. This is because I am particularly 
interested in tackling environmental crime, in particular wildlife crime. After 
my studies I would be interested in working as a geospatial intelligence analyst, 
and applying this wildlife crime. For this, GIS is an important skill to have, 
hence I started a second Master here at the UvA, a MSc.
