### Bachelor

For my bachelor thesis, I assessed how the water-energy nexus in China will 
be affected by climate change. With the projected climate change, China faces 
significant issues, among which water insecurity. Pollution is also a real 
problem, as well as the growing population that China will have to be able 
to sustain. Energy production demands huge amounts of water, whereas water 
withdrawal and treatment demand huge amounts of energy. Given the 
interconnectedness between the water and energy sectors, to fully examine 
the effects of climate change and population growth, a nexus-based approach 
is necessary. First, the water-energy nexus is quantified with a per capita 
economic value for the year 2014 for each province, where after two different 
scenarios are modelled; a business as usual (BAU) scenario and a water and 
energy saving (WES) scenario. Correlation analysis is performed and the results 
are visualized using GIS. Water and energy saving strategies are examined. This 
thesis finds that China has no choice but to shift their energy production from 
fossil fuels to renewables; wind and solar power in particular. To tackle the 
water deficit problem in northern China, the Southâ€“North Water Transfer Project 
has been set in place.

### Master

For my master thesis, I explored to what extent the current legal framework 
regarding transboundary conservation complexes in Southern Africa allows for 
co-operation among states, by closely analysing a number of transboundary 
conservation complex treaties and Memoranda of Understanding. A number of 
transboundary conservation complexes in Southern Africa have established MEAs, 
all of which set in place an institutional framework allowing for joint 
decision-making and joint management of the transfrontier parks and transfrontier 
conservation areas. Legislative reforms are necessary to strengthen the management 
regimes of transboundary conservation complexes. Some provisions appear to be 
loosely drafted, leaving perhaps too much room for interpretation, while some 
treaties are lacking several general principles of international law.
